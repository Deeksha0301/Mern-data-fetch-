# Backend Server Documentation
This documentation provides an overview of the backend server code and its functionalities.

### Setup and Configuration
- The backend server is built using Express.js, a Node.js web application framework.
- MongoDB is used as the database, and the connection URL is specified in the .env file using the DB_URL environment variable.
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled to allow cross-origin requests.

### API Endpoints

    - $sort stage: Sorting the results by user count and average income in descending order.
    - $limit stage: Limiting the results to the top 10 cities.
- The retrieved cities are then sent as a JSON response using res.json(cities).

# Frontend Documentation
This documentation provides an overview of the frontend code and its functionalities.

## User Table Component
- The Usertable component displays a table of user data.
- It receives the users prop, which contains an array of user objects.
- The component implements pagination to display a specified number of users per page.
- The table columns include First Name, Last Name, Email, Gender, Income, City, Car, Quote, Phone Price, and Average Income.

## FilterButton Component
- The FilterButton component represents a single filter button.
- It receives the filterType prop, which specifies the type of filter to be applied.
- Clicking the filter button triggers an API call to retrieve the filtered user data based on the specified filter type.
- The filtered user data is passed back to the Home component and stored in the filteredUsers state.

## Home Component
- The Home component serves as the main component that renders the user table and filter buttons.
- It maintains a state variable filteredUsers to store the filtered user data.
- Filter buttons trigger API calls to retrieve filtered user data based on different filter types.
- The filtered user data is passed to the Usertable component for rendering.

## Axios Requests
- The axios library is used to make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints.

## Styling
- Inline styling is used to define the styles for different components and elements.
